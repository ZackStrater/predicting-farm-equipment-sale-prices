    "## Topic Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your campus (check with your instructors), you and your group have \n",
    "two options for this case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice 1: [Forecast HIV incidence in US counties](forecast_HIV_infections/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using data merged from several databases, you are asked to build a model that\n",
    "predicts HIV incidence for US counties.**  You should also identify and report\n",
    "the most significant drivers of HIV infection and how they vary between counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more [here](./forecast_HIV_infections/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Major challenges\n",
    "1. Non-normal distribution of features, possibly requires thoughtful, domain knowledge based feature engineering, data preprocessing or feature tranformation\n",
    "2. Require manual splitting of training data and test data.\n",
    "3. Data comes from various sources, which requires careful reading to understand the exact meaning of the data.\n",
    "4. Need to be aware of possible data leaking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice 2: [Predict the sale price of heavy equipment at auction](predict_auction_price/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based\n",
    "on its usage, equipment type, and configuration.**  The data is sourced from auction\n",
    "result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more [here](./predict_auction_price/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Major challenges\n",
    "1. Need to learn to use script to evaluate results\n",
    "2. Instruction information for completion is more than [Choice 1: Forecast HIV incidence in US counties](#choice-1-forecast-hiv-incidence-in-us-counties).\n",
    "3. Lots of missing data in data set.\n",
    "4. Need to be aware of possible data leaking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day your group will be expected to present for 5-10\n",
    "minutes on your findings.  Present results from your README.md.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cover the following in your presentation.\n",

    "## Case Study Goal\n",
    "Predict the `sale price` of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction, based\n",
    "on its usage, equipment type, and configuration.  The data is sourced from auction\n",
    "result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "The evaluation of your model will be based on Root Mean Squared Log Error.\n",
    "Which is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error](images/rmsle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "where *p<sub>i</sub>* are the predicted values (predicted auction sale prices) \n",
    "and *a<sub>i</sub>* are the actual values (the actual auction sale prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this loss function is sensitive to the *ratio* of predicted values to\n",
    "the actual values, a prediction of 200 for an actual value of 100 contributes\n",
    "approximately the same amount to the loss as a prediction of 2000 for an actual\n",
    "value of 1000.  To convince yourself of this, recall that a difference of\n",
    "logarithms is equal to a single logarithm of a ratio, and rewrite each summand\n",
    "as a single logarithm of a ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loss function is implemented in [`loss_model.py`](./loss_model.py). Read it to understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backgrounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check the original Kaggle contest [page]((https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The data for this case study are in `./data`. Although there are both training\n",
    "and testing data sets, the testing data set [test.csv](./data/test.csv) should **`only`** be utilized to evaluate\n",
    "your final model performance at the end of the day. Also, the ground truth of the test data is in [ground_truth/test_actual.csv](./data/ground_truth/test_actual.csv). Think about it as your\n",
    "hold out set.  Use cross-validation on the training data set [train_1.csv](./data/train_1.csv) and [train_2.csv](./data/train_2.csv) to identify your\n",
    "best model and report the performance of your best model on the test data at the end of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint: use `cat` to concatenate `train_1.csv` and `train_2.csv` to a single `train.csv` file.\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  cat train_1.csv train_2.csv > train.csv\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the same test data and the same evaluation metric (RMSLE) the relative\n",
    "performance of different group's models on this case study can be assessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [data_dictionary.csv](./data/data_dictionary.csv) is included that explains the columns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the `loss_model.py` script\n",
    "Included is a loss function to test your predictions of the test set against the provided hold out test set.  This follows a common setup in competitions such as Kaggle, where this came from.  In these types of setups, there is a labeled train set to do your modeling and feature tuning.  There is also a provided hold-out test set to compare your predictions against.  You will need to fit a model on the training data and get a prediction for all the data in the test set.  You will then need to create csv containing the field 'SalesID' and 'SalePrice' (must match exactly). An example file is created for you [Example_Output.csv](./data/Example_Output.csv). This csv file will be the input parameter to running the function.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "In terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python loss_model.py <path to csv file>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following command returns `0.7802091986822471`\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "This case study is based on [Kaggle's Blue Book for Bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers) competition.  The best RMSLE was only 0.23 (obviously lower is better).\n",
    ">  Note that if you were to simply guess the median auction price for all the pieces of equipment in the test set you would get an RMSLE of about 0.7.\n",

    "## Appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This data is quite messy. Try to use your judgement about where your\n",
    "cleaning efforts will yield the most results and focus there first.\n",
    "2. Because of the restriction to linear models, you will have to carefully\n",
    "consider how to transform continuous predictors in your model.\n",
    "3. Remember any transformations you apply to the training data will also have\n",
    "to be applied to the testing data, so plan accordingly.\n",
    "4. Any transformations of the training data that *learn parameters* (for\n",
    "example, standardization learns the mean and variance of a feature) must only\n",
    "use parameters learned from the *training data*.\n",
    "5. It's possible some columns in the test data will take on values not seen in\n",
    "the training data. Plan accordingly.\n",
    "6. Use your intuition to *think about where the strongest signal about a price\n",
    "is likely to come from*. If you weren't fitting a model, but were asked to use\n",
    "this data to predict a price what would you do? Can you combine the model with\n",
    "your intuitive instincts?  This is important because it can be done *without\n",
    "looking at the data*; thinking about the problem has no risk of overfitting.\n",
    "7. Start simply. Fit a basic model and make sure you're able to get the submission \n",
    "working then iterate to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Remember that you are evaluated on a loss function that is only sensitive to\n",
    "the *ratios* of predicted to actual values.  It's almost certainly too much of\n",
    "a task to implement an algorithm that minimizes this loss function directly in\n",
    "the time you have, but there are some steps you can take to do a good job of\n",
    "it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restrictions\n",
    "Please use only *regression* methods for this case study.  The following techniques\n",
    "are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Linear Regression.\n",
    "  - Logistic Regression.\n",
    "  - Median Regression (linear regression by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations).\n",
    "  - Any other [GLM](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/glm.html).\n",
    "  - Regularization: Ridge and LASSO.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use other models or algorithms as supplements (for example, in feature\n",
    "engineering), but your final submissions must be losses from a linear type\n",
    "model.\n",
